        The CSV file has a delimiter ',' and has 12 columns. An example of one row in the csv file is:  
    </p>

    <p>
        One TV Show can have multiple actors. The way this is implemented in the CSV file is that we repeat the occurrence of the show for the number of times that the show has actors in the data set. For example, if we have 2 actors in a show in our data set (Kaley Cuoco and Jim Parsons) the CSV representation will be:
    </p>
    <p>
        1,1,1,1,The big bang theory,A woman who moves into an apartment across the hall from two brilliant but socially awkward physicist shows them how little they know about life outside of the laboratory.,158,3,t,Jim Parsons,comedy,US
    </p>
    <p>
        1,1,2,1,The big bang theory,A woman who moves into an apartment across the hall from two brilliant but socially awkward physicist shows them how little they know about life outside of the laboratory.,158,3,t,Kaley Cuoco,comedy,US
    </p>
    <p>
        The id's are here for possible future queries in the database since they are the primary keys of the data set. 
    </p>

    <h2>JSON</h2>
    <p>The JSON file is best to bee seen on an example that has 2 shows.</p>

    <p>
        The atributes are mostly the same as in the CSV file and they are all self documenting. The only difference is that we can get clearer nesting in a JSON that provides better understing and semantics of data. For example we have added a new key "actores" that has a value of an array of actors. We did the same for country and genre which provides the user of the JSON a better understanding of the content that is provided.
